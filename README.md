## Project Description:
Project 1: Facility Management System Design and Implementation

In this project, we will start providing an object domain model for Facility Management System by addressing the design and implementation using OOP. The aim is to have a domain model that is designed using OOP that will be used to study Object relationship and Dependency.

Based on the specification provided for a Facility Management System:

– Identify the main entitles of the problem domain.

– Identify their attributes.

– Identify their relationships.

– Identify their roles and responsibilities.

– Discover other objects that facilitate implementing responsibilities.

– Make available all client interfaces/services specified in the specification document (Facility, Facility Use, and Facility Maintenance Client Interfaces).

### Supporting Documents:
 - Requirement - Facility Management System Specification Document.
 - Object Modeling.
 - A UML Modeling tool for documentation.
